Wow, what a year of reading! You checked out a whopping 95 books from the SF Public Library - that's a lot of pages turned and stories devoured! Some highlights from your library haul include "Higher Magic" by Courtney Floyd, "Cinder House" by Freya Marske, and "The Wedding People" by Alison Espach. And the best part? By borrowing from the library, you saved a staggering amount of cash - approximately $2,185 (95 books x $23 per book). That's like buying a whole new bookshelf (or two, or three...)! Here's to another year of reading, saving, and loving your library!
