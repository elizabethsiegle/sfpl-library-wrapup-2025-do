Wow, what a year of reading! You checked out a whopping 95 books from the SF Public Library - that's a lot of page-turning, book-loving fun! Some highlights from your literary adventures include "Higher Magic" by Courtney Floyd, "Cinder House" by Freya Marske, and "The Wedding People" by Alison Espach. And the best part? You saved a small fortune by borrowing from the library instead of buying! Assuming each book costs around $23, you saved a staggering $2,185 this year. Cheers to you, dear reader, for being a library rockstar and making the most of your local library's amazing resources!
